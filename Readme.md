# mark-doc

tl;dr; write documents in markdown, view them in Chrome.

This is a system for markdown-html pages.
The idea is to be able to make an entire file in markdown,
and then view it fully rendered in a browser,
with minimal hassle.

It is designed for documents; specifically for writing PHD papers.
So it has a lot of extras, such as reference management, built in.
